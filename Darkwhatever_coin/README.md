1. Try some input: team1

- After the input, we can see the SQL as hint:ã€€
```
<!-- SELECT teamname, balance FROM balances WHERE teamname='team1' -->
```

2. Instead of team1, we can try to insert extra items at the end of SQL
- Try another input: team1' or teamname=team2'

- After the input, we can see it displays team1 and team2

3. For SQL where clause, we can put a statement in between to make it always TRUE, thus the SQL statment can display all records in the table
- Input: team1' or 1=1 or teamname=team2'
